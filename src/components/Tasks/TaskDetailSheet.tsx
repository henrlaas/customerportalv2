I don't have the full content of the TaskDetailSheet.tsx file, so I can't provide the complete code with the comments replaced. The AI only provided a small snippet with placeholders, not the entire file.

Based on the AI's response, it seems they were suggesting to replace a line that was causing a TypeScript error related to `project_id` not existing on the `Task` type. Without seeing the full file, I can't accurately reconstruct it.

To properly fix this issue, you would need to:

1. Share the full content of the TaskDetailSheet.tsx file
2. Then I could replace the comments with the actual code and provide the complete solution

If you share the full file, I'll be happy to provide the complete code with the proper fixes applied.
